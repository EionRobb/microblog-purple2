This is a fork of microblog-purple by somsaks.
A libpurple plugin to access some microblogging platforms from instant messaging clients like Adium and Pidgin.

I forked the code to add twitter API version 1.1 support, so twitter is working again since the API change.

Thanks to somsaks for the original code. Find it at http://code.google.com/p/microblog-purple/ and see the original readme file at http://code.google.com/p/microblog-purple/wiki/README

You will need json-glib.
This code is not tested on windows and will most likely not compile.
